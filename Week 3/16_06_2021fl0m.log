2021-06-16 21:13:31,289	devanb97	@heyimfink they have dumb draft picks and are still “rebuilding” if Buffalo is going to get rid of eichel they’re basically saying we’re tearing it all down and going for it again so you could offload some picks to them and maybe 1-2 roster players/prospects

2021-06-16 21:29:44,261	h2owolfman	i think it depends on the game. Like cs i think its fine to just keep doing onlines until we get crowds, but games like siege, the most competitive gameplay is on lan because of the destruction and amount of influence a piece a util has

2021-06-16 21:29:51,676	apodis10	i'd prefer them playing in a studio because it lowers the chances of random fuckery like the loss thing, but experience-wise as a viewer it's the same

2021-06-16 21:30:07,149	vchair23	what I'm still not sure of - is if we'll see a difference in performance for how long people have been primarily playing from home vs a studio vs a full lan, if that all makes sense
