2021-06-20 19:23:09,450	im2meta4u	fl0m you're yawning a lot, how many dads did you fuck last night? Kapp nah but fr are you alright?
2021-06-20 19:23:12,519	elad_o	twitch stopped following the rules a long time ago.. look at streamers that got over 3 bans for improper behavior and didn't lose their channels
2021-06-20 19:23:23,779	bigboy3003	g2 go 7-8 half now i guess

2021-06-20 19:23:27,528	mostackstv	Isn't the workaround just to have split your audio in OBS and delete audio after stream?

2021-06-20 19:23:31,228	c1ove47	is it because he always plays 21 savage in the back

2021-06-20 19:24:43,030	suprauk_	Twitch has said that all of the DMCA strikes are on VODS so yes, splitting audio will likely help prevent that

2021-06-20 19:27:16,477	marshan307	Yes. That's why rappers back in the day became smart enough to start their own labels but even then distribution rights is a whole diff story.

2021-06-20 21:31:55,190	prakharvidyarthi	dupreeh would be a neat pickup for nearly any team that can comm in english/danish
2021-06-20 21:31:57,747	chillasey	Why don't other tournaments follow the RMR coaching rules? Is it just preference for their product?
2021-06-20 21:31:58,083	twentylulw	NIP needs to replace someone if they want to be t1
2021-06-20 21:32:02,588	maxofmine	Astralis felt like Navi now

2021-06-20 21:32:43,191	ficii	Just wait until he plays Liquid again
2021-06-20 21:32:44,883	maartenv1	dupreeh instead of rex or lopski, maybe dupreeh even 6th man

2021-06-20 21:32:51,684	zeref7o	Ploksi has kinda dropped off after dev1ce has joined. Plopski was like top fragging all the time before that

2021-06-20 21:34:12,060	shutthafoxup	Which is part of my point, people see guys on Ast playing super well and assume they'll be as good without gla1ve's system in place
2021-06-20 21:34:25,616	twentylulw	cloud 9 was a disaster
2021-06-20 21:34:30,108	dimitripascaluta	you said it before but NiP need to poach someone from Fnatic. KRIMZ or Brollan would be a godsend.

2021-06-20 21:34:58,678	bubsngorf	@Zinc_VI gambit for sure, even tho im a huge navi fan
2021-06-20 21:35:08,257	tengee36	the main reason they went to G2 was because hunter liked the way the org did things. and the only reason niko went to G2 was because hunter wanted to play for G2
2021-06-20 21:35:12,936	migbryan	G2 be like: amma take that

2021-06-20 21:35:36,711	chillasey	wow i had never heard of that news that Niko/Hunter were going to C9. I thought it was just woxic that he lost in that team
2021-06-20 21:35:37,047	fedl1ngen	Krimz on NiP could be huuuuuge.

2021-06-20 22:05:06,494	nanerpus_	To be clear, in Project A, shooting matters. You don’t kill with abilities. Abilities create tactical opportunities to take the right shot. Characters have abilities that augment their gunplay, instead of fighting directly with their abilities.
2021-06-20 22:05:07,699	carbbin_	we'll be lucky if we see an economy update for csgo in the next year

2021-06-20 22:08:05,601	dvkirn	unreal is also inherently designed to me modified
2021-06-20 22:08:06,857	deenottv	@fl0m do you think they will update cs to source 2?

2021-06-20 22:12:46,751	robertcamposs	make the starting money 1000 and change the kit value to 200
2021-06-20 22:12:52,338	cow1337kills	@fl0m what about the M249 in csgo it hasn't been viable in years
2021-06-20 22:12:55,906	ficii	I think the guns are pretty balanced, except the deagles 2 hit kill body spam. That's just dumb

2021-06-20 22:13:59,104	i_odinson	bringing unranked to the game, they are atleast looking towards the hacking issue
2021-06-20 22:13:59,800	ficii	They added mp5, which is silenced mp7 with lower base damage and faster running speed
2021-06-20 22:14:00,133	halibut552	I can almost smell the "upset"

2021-06-20 22:14:02,533	bluehipp0	actually, make a gun that backfires! Like randomly 1 out of 200 shots hits you in the face
2021-06-20 22:14:04,694	dankiyy	last time we got a new gun was the mp5 implementation
2021-06-20 22:14:06,132	uncontinued	@fl0m  what are your thoughts on if they add a T side rifle with silencer?
2021-06-20 22:14:10,113	lewiex	the sg fires real slow lol

2021-06-20 22:14:12,261	slb_	didnt one of the developers who worked on csgo say that there wont be an update to source 2 because csgos code is pretty doodoo?

2021-06-20 22:14:17,954	lewiex	aug op
2021-06-20 22:14:20,041	shutthafoxup	Get rid of operations, have constantly rotating events, each with new or returning maps, give REAL incentives to playing the new maps instead of ticking off challenges. Rank reset every month or two so people keep playing to improve their ranking from month to month.
2021-06-20 22:14:22,655	jibbadee	@fl0m Would you ever have a reason for justifying the R8 over the Deag?
2021-06-20 22:14:28,559	bluehipp0	you should also be able to use the M249 and it should make sense somehow
2021-06-20 22:14:30,955	muchawi	A4 is still way better right, in general

2021-06-20 22:15:34,106	bluehipp0	@siiiif how many lines of code does it have roughly then?
2021-06-20 22:15:34,621	dave_tbone	what would you think of a source 2 counter strike game that's separate from csgo?
2021-06-20 22:15:36,904	ficii	I mean, the game is 9 years old, and with the amount of updates it had, of course the code will be completely fucked at some point

2021-06-20 22:18:28,704	graf3132	their own calls lose games for them to me but im not that smart so
2021-06-20 22:18:31,197	k1ngc4p	@fl0m people want quality of life improvements associated with source 2 not an engine change, it would be insanely hard to switch engines and maintain the level of optimization we currently have
2021-06-20 22:18:31,671	timematrix	@hugostigz710 not trolling. My best weapon is UMP. I've been working on rifling recently though.

2021-06-20 22:23:55,678	im2meta4u	curtcolt that's so that the upper bracket guys have the advantage cause they didn't drop to lowers
2021-06-20 22:23:58,869	moonshinertv	@fl0m I think Valve should use CSGO beta to go balls to the wall with changes and new stuff, and whatever works could be ported to the new game, with proper balancing ofc
