2021-06-27 20:58:41,468	n0r13k	With me not obviously coming from the area, he inquired about why I was there, so I explained to him the situation about my grandmother.
2021-06-27 20:58:46,427	n0r13k	He said "oh man, that's so sad. can we get five gifted?". Originally I laughed, but he ignored me until I opened up the Twitch app on my phone and gifted the five. He proceeded to pull some sort of mug from his ass and wave it in my face, saying "hey anon, thanks for the five mcgifties" and complemented my penis.
