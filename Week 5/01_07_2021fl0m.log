2021-07-01 21:22:24,099	real_donald_trump_nokapp	use his sound cue and if hes close you see him
2021-07-01 21:22:27,887	shadowbringersletsgo	it makes a sound when he exits it
2021-07-01 21:22:28,224	priiide_	he also makes a fuck ton of noise when he comes out of the ult
2021-07-01 21:22:30,951	wack_ar	you can see at close plus that that noise plays when he comes out
2021-07-01 21:22:34,364	chosendew	@PhireNEyece he didnt tp he ulted
2021-07-01 21:22:37,783	backupbridge	did he not use his E?
2021-07-01 21:22:39,226	dankiyy	i dont think so but you heard him run past
2021-07-01 21:22:42,617	strawhat1g	Listen for the audio queues on his abilities
2021-07-01 21:22:43,256	beststststs	@fl0m ask com he will explain
2021-07-01 21:22:45,269	stitchwave	that sound you heard when holding your angle was his tp behind you witch you can shoot
2021-07-01 21:22:46,915	bladescott13	no he ul
2021-07-01 21:22:48,673	leftum	You heard him running around its a humming noise and then a louder noise when he exits ult
2021-07-01 21:22:56,091	acidrift	@fl0m you should've been able to hear the ORB being so close to his TP orb, maybe HRTF beinf off or you not realizing the sound?
2021-07-01 21:22:56,872	deathspate	He's shit don't worry, you can not know what he does and still win against him KEKW
2021-07-01 21:23:01,320	shiftyx21	He also needs to come out of ult to shoot so the counter play is the sound queue
2021-07-01 21:23:03,063	chosendew	@fl0m ask c0m how the yoru ult works
2021-07-01 21:23:17,365	priiide_	^
2021-07-01 21:23:36,682	strawhat1g	His teleport makes a decently loud sound, and when he exits his ult he makes a loud sound
2021-07-01 21:23:43,805	deathspate	Yeah, the agent so bad Riot reworking him already

2021-07-01 21:23:50,186	dankiyy	yeah it makes a really obnoxious noise when he ends ult

2021-07-01 22:05:12,283	arnarhr	@two_drop yeah, abilities are a little more expensive and cooldowns are longer so there's more tradeoff in guns v abilities
2021-07-01 22:05:12,615	kooshyy	@fl0m i dont play valorant but ik A BIT BUT TF is that fish thing  the enemy are using
